This is a research project for a physics class. <br>
The pipeline system sends prompts to Gemini in order to optimize radial velocity (RV) data points. In other words, Gemini is used as an RV optimizer. <br>
Although users can write code to create an RV solver, this pipeline offers an alternative approach that does not require programming. <br>
Users simply write prompts in plain English to solve RV problems. <br> <br>

Of course, the system is written in Python, so I had to write code ðŸ˜‚
