This is a research project for a physics class.
The pipeline system sends prompts to Gemini in order to optimize radial velocity (RV) data points. In other words, Gemini is used as an RV optimizer.
Although users can write code to create an RV solver, this pipeline offers an alternative approach that does not require programming.
Users simply write prompts in plain English to solve RV problems.

Of course, the system is written in Python, so I had to write code ðŸ˜‚
